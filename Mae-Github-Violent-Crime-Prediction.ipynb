    "Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for \n",
    "attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; \n",
    "attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus \n",
    "the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in \n",
    "the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered \n",

    "crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, \n",
    "and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the \n",
    "counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in \n",
    "incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the \n",

    "Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population \n",
    "attribute has a mean value of 0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An \n",

    "values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to 0.00)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN \n",
